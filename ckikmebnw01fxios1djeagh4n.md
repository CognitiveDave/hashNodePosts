## You want to get into Machine Learning!

You are, probably, a pretty good developer, but you are looking over your shoulder.  Perhaps you mastered Java, Spring boot, and are comfortable with microservices,  backend and frontend topics.  Did you do a project where some Wizz kid was in charge of Machine Learning? Did you wonder what's involved, it seemed really cool, right?  Well, I am here to enlighten you about the topic. Let me tell you one thing up front!  Machines don't learn at all!  There is no such thing as Machine Learning!   Ugh oh, I just wrote something which might seem strange and blasphemy.

These are machines that I built (assembled), and I find no evidence of the machine growing, learning, and developing. Machines are physically limited to the day they were born.  Ok, some machines are upgradeable though!  Yeah, because I build my own Hardware configurations I can swap parts, upgrade and re-configure.  That isn't machine learning.  What! If machines don't learn then what is Machine Learning?  Data Science? And why did that Whizz kid have some Intellectual halo and majesty about them?

## Machine Learning
Machines do not learn like children. A machine never grows up; it is born perfect for the specific use case it was designed for. Out of the box, those machines are already finished learning. Now there are frequent micro-code updates,  bios and EEPROM flashes, operating system upgrades,  driver updates and more relevant to our little discussion, library updates.  However, machines are very good at running routine tasks which might otherwise not be possible or even feasible.

"Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention."  [from SaS](https://www.sas.com/en_ie/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html). Do you like that explanation?  I am comfortable with the way they explain it.

When I mention SaS naturally, I am not referring to the British SAS as a unit of the Army though I enjoy thinking about the parallels. Consider the following image; I found whilst reading  [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk), it featured in an  [article about Kenya](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/kenya-british-sas-soldier-stormed-to-the-rescue-in-nairobi-hotel-attack-6jnnxjjd3).

If a machine learning model represents a Bridge, in a combat zone, then the engineering core needs to be sure that the Bridge is robust and will take the weight that will pass over it.  It also needs to be strong such that it can withstand skud missiles or other small arms fire.

The Combat Zone, in my imagination, is the current project. So if you will deploy to the 'Theatre of Battle' you need to have the right equipment to match the engagement.  But what equipment do you need to perform the analysis and build that model?

### Combat ready
Much like the picture of that soldier, you need equipment, and it must be fit for purpose.

1. ***Communications*.**  I imagine that Soldiers are excellent at communication.  They have a dialect that is crisp and clear, and there is no doubt about a status report.  "Echo tango tango" - "Boogey at 12 O'Clock".  Anyone doing Machine Learning also has to have this skill.  Be it clarifying the project objectives,  providing initial feedback, or communicating a technical design, it needs to be crystal clear, and the message needs to be received and acknowledged.  "Tango Tango copy that!  COPY."

2. ***Body armour*** You need a Ballistic plate under your skin.  There is a need for mental toughness in Machine Learning. Why? Surely this is overly dramatic!  Machine Learning is performed by providing an Algorithm with a Data Set and catching the eventual outcome. The process could run for 1 second or 1 year. The longer it runs, the more self-doubt and anxiety will pop into your mind and undermine your confidence.  Other times you will get cryptic error messages little scud missiles or land mines going off, around you!  Some of those incidents might be incredibly difficult to understand. Others might offer opinions, and Subject Matter Experts might disagree with the initial findings. So everyone will have input and politics can be lethal in the skirmish.

3. ***Supplies***, extra **ammunition**, and required equipment. If you wish to do Machine Learning, you need supplies.  Food,  Water,  a comfortable office,  computer resources,  Business domain knowledge,  teammates,  and Algorithm documentation.  Again to our soldier,  the soldier might be deployed 'in-country' for days and cannot simply pop into 'Tesco' for a drink.  Machine Learning practitioners should take a similar approach.  Plan the work before deploying.

4. ***Small combat knife*** I equate this to your personal workstation. Do you prefer a Mac, Linux or Windows?  A tablet, mobile phone.  Whatever workstation you are using, it needs to be sharp and comfortable to use.

5. ***Assault rifle*** For those distant shots, training a deep neural network, you will need a high powered server, with plenty of RAM, and cores. There are plenty of offerings on IBM Cloud, Azure, GCP,  AWS so you can rent by the hour as you deploy "in-country" and you only pay for each shot (per-second billing). The soldier will want to be sure of a clean line of sight before pulling the trigger. Those slugs are very expensive.

6. ***The pistol*** for that quick effective 'closure'.  In my imagination, perhaps I drank too much coffee already,  but I see the GPU, TPU,  or FPGA devices as the pistol. Cloud-based instances, with all the usual vendors, provide access to these devices.  Again rent one for the specific engagement, and pay per second based on your shooting, like the soldier, you want to be sure of a clean line of sight before you pull the trigger.  The project budget isn't infinite, and traditional IT control everything.

**Combat readiness** however, isn't limited to a set of equipment and equipment doesn't make the ** soldier of machine learning**â€”private first class, ML squad, First Brigade the Royal Irish. In case you already think this is a crazy article,  you don't believe it is WAR, think buddy think!. It is a war zone, and you have to accept that!

You might come up against **Mercenaries** retained by Big Firms spreading propaganda about their units.  Some launch Scud missiles into your C-Suite and scare the board with voodoo talk. Those mercenaries are well funded, well equipped and well practised in their craft. They are experts in extracting your budget!  You have to understand these mercenaries and be able to work with them to your advantage.  It's competitive!

So the Soldier, like the Soccer Player,  Formula 1 Driver or Marathon runner, needs to be match fit.  Match fitness means training in your art. Reading about articles,  use cases, practising your coding skills, and focusing on the accuracy of those models of the world.  As a software engineer, you can write code, and that code will likely finish successfully.  Return code 0 - congratulations your code compiles and the compiler found nothing to complain about. Here is the big news, Buddy!  The fact that you can write a script/source code file that runs or compiles is no guarantee at all that it is correct or applies to the world.  This is really true with Machine Learning.  Loading a dataset,  transforming that to the specification for the algorithm, calling the algorithm (.fit() ) and that all running fine does NOTHING! Nothing at all.  You have proved again that you can code.

Are you furious with me now?  Surely everyone knows that a code compilation isn't a guarantee of correctness.  Then again, I read a lot of Machine Learning articles, posts, tutorials, and I have this sense that throwing a workflow together with cleaned-up data is overemphasised every time. That really isn't Machine Learning at all - that is coding!  ***So if you want to get into Machine Learning*** and you think you will be coding then you might be stunned and even disappointed.  As a soldier, you should be clear on your mission, objectives,  and how you will judge your mission 'DONE' and successful. Others will judge you, and you are thinking about a field which is extremely hyped with unrealistic expectations. The C-Suite level is constantly aggravated by those incoming Scud missiles from mercenary firms trying to make a buck!  Aren't we all trying to make a buck! Everyone has opinions, and those mercenaries like to tell your bosses you are on the wrong track and naturally their guys have something "ALREADY". The C-Suite have an obligation to the owners and shareholders and are forced to use external advisors.  Those advisors have mercenaries ready to deploy.

Do you still want to get into Machine Learning?

## Doing it well
So you went off and trained, did your PhD in Machine Learning or Data Science,  wrote a lot of code, congratulations you think you are Combat Ready!  You are well versed on sharp knives,  assault rifles,  and handguns! Perhaps you are a really great developer and want to get involved in the 'Sexist Job of the 21st Century'.  Are you combat ready?

I got this image from the SaS article I referred to earlier on.  Since you are Combat Ready, these things don't need any explanation at all!  Right!

Let me touch on some of the highlights.

- Data preparation capabilities:  I always laugh when I read this, I am laughing now.  Does that seem odd to you?  I am a Crazy Blogger Dude, here on HashNode.  Well first off we have the massive assumption that the data exists.  News Flash Guys! Oftentimes the data really doesn't exist in the way we think it might.  So you might have to go off and actually collect the data.  Data preparation capabilities are all fine and good if the data has been collected, is accessible, and someone actually cares enough to extract for you.  Guess what, dudes,  most people are busy, and they either don't know, don't care,  or are too busy to extract data for someone else.  I wrote about this topic over on  [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/doing-data-science-from-scratch-dab71253e777). Doing Data Science from Scratch is a fun series but challenging to write.

- Since you are Combat Ready, you probably think you have a good handle **on the Algorithms** - basic and advanced concepts.  You know all about hyper tuning parameters, the statistical concepts, the confusion matrix, and other measures of accuracy.  You are pretty sure you know what will generalize and what will not.  You are mentally tough, oh, boy, you are ready. Well, think again, Buddy! Most industries are heavily regulated.  Black box algorithms are really sexy, but we need explainable AI. Enter the world of Bias, Controversy, Discrimination, Exploitation, and Naked Capitalism (greed).  Through in a dollop of data privacy, "un-regulated" social media, and politicians who think they control the masses.  Still, do you think I am crazy to declare Machine Learning as a battleground?  It's war, and there is no way to get around that. The battle is for supremacy over AI/ML.  Nation-states are squared off; global multi-nationals are fighting each other for market share. Regulators and Government agencies are drawing lines in the sand. It's a real royal rumble which makes Black Box algorithms, trade-offs,  heuristics, all difficult to defend on the battlefield.

- Automation and iterative processes: I see this one in terms of those long-run jobs for deep learning, data collection. Do you know how to automate your little jobs?  As a developer, you do!  The other thing is repeatable research.  Those industry regulators, auditors,  local and national authorities all have rules, and I guess if you run your code, on different days, would it produce the same results.  Processes are terribly important.

- Scalability: So you went off and trained a classifier on a small data set. The accuracy is 95%.  You are proud of yourself.  You deploy it to production and hey presto you have arrived.  Your model is exposed on the inference server, and we are waiting for the first 100 API calls to see how it is doing.  We expect 95% accuracy because that was what we got based on our quick & dirty training exercise.  Deadlines are deadlines, and our competitors have an AI feature - we need one now as well.  "Get it done Dude".  But after 10mins the traditional IT dude slacks you and says - hey we are having problems! It must be your code. You are there why? Cause we don't understand what you did and therefore we told the Exec. It was your piece!  The API calls are indeed failing.  The model inference is timing out.  Too many API calls?  Other log entries suggest that the model is labelling most of the calls as 'FALSE' but how can this be.  The model isn't generalizing at all; in fact, it is worse than not having it. So any AI/ML feature must be able to handle calls at scale and must meet the minimum accuracy requirements in PRODUCTION otherwise the business faces lost revenue,  breaches of regulatory requirements, and potential lawsuits due to BIAS against certain sectors of the population.  It really must scale correctly.

- Ensemble modelling: Suffice it to say I love this one.  You are Combat Ready, so you know what this is.  No one approach, or model, might be sufficient; therefore, we combine a lot of different approaches and take an aggregated answered.  Why make an inference from a single Decision Tree when you can use a Random Forest instead right?

## Do you really want to get into Machine Learning?
There is no right or wrong answer to this one.  So many books,  courses,  PhD, MSc Degrees are available now it seems the profession is heading towards a commodity. Indeed AutoML is here that really speeds up the cleaning, model selection, feature engineering,  training, and accuracy metrics.  Hell, the citizens are using drag & drop UI's to build their models. They don't even use a line of code at all.  So if you are a really talented developer, you need to think about sticking with your core skill or dipping your toe in the Shark Tank of AL/ML ops, AutoML,  or the Sexy world of Deep Learning, Computer Vision,  and Natural Language Processing.

I love it, but I am always wrong and seen as an amateur mostly.  Whatever you do, keep a good interlock with Traditional IT, your Data Privacy Officer,  and your Legal team, someday soon the good guys will come knocking. Data Privacy is a big thing! And it touches AI/ML deeply.

Did you enjoy reading my article? If so, I have many more, but please feel free to tell me.  Smash the like, dislike, bullshit, love, hate buttons and let's have the debate.
